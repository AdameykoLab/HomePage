We, as a team, support the diversity in thinking and favor natural curiosity of our members. This is why we always run some small hobby projects on a side in any area of modern biology and biomedicine â€“ spanning from the mechanisms of integration operating within coral colonies to the studies of the composition of early multicellular life forms. We believe that the lab environment must be invigorating, and the broad scope together with great opportunities to tackle natural puzzles serve this function pretty well.  

Some of our science-related hobby activities are represented on Instagram and other media channels:
