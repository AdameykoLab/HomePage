My PhD aims to to expand our views on the evolution of neural crest properties. More precisely by unravelling the cell fate decisions of neural crests cells during mouse development and by exploring the heterogeneity of glial cells during development and adulthood in mouse. 

My current work is mainly based on the usage of bioinformatic tools such as single-cell transcriptomics data analysis, clustering, pseudotime ordering, combined with biological experiments for validation.
