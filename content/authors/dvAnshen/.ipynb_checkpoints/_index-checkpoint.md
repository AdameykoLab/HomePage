During my masterÂ´s thesis worked on the interaction of the embryonic autonomic nervous system and cardiogenesis, focusing also on the temporal establishment of the cardiac innervation. Now, excited to start my PhD (Molecular Neuroscience), I will expand my reasearch to study cellular and molecular mechanims driving morphogenesis and the establishment of the peripheral nervous system during murine embryogenesis.
