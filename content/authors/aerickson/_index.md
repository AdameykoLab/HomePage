My long-term research goal is to understand the organizational principles that link cell fate decisions with tissue morphogenesis. To approach this, I currently use lineage tracing, genetic perturbations, single-cell transcriptomics, and microscopy to study how cell signaling networks control the dynamic clonal behaviors in the neural crest. I am also concerned with promoting a healthy connection between biological research and the humanities.
