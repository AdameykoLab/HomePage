I am interested in all the diversity of cellular processes neural crest cells take part in: from the formation of individual facial features to the development of the peripheral nervous system. But my main PhD project focus is on tracking the developmental origin of Ewing sarcoma, where I unravel whether neural crest-derived differentiation could be an alternative cell-of-origin candidate for sarcomas. As a model system for this, I use human pluripotent stem cell cultures differentiated into downstream cellular fates and further analyze their gene expression changes on a single-cell level using bioinformatic tools.
