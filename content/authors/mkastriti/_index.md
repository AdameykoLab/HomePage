My projects focus on neural crest and peripheral glia lineages (Schwann cell precursors and Schwann cells) and their multipotency . Specifically, I am interested in the mechanisms driving the differentiation or maintaining the stem cell-like properties of embryonic progenitors. Lastly, I am following the same processes in the postnatal organism while making evolutionary connections around cell types of the peripheral nervous system.
