My work in the Adameyko Lab focuses on developing spatial transcriptomic methods, which is especially useful for developmental biology. We are using both array-based and probe-based methods of spatial transcriptomics, both utilizing automated imaging and fluidics. By adding spatial information to modern RNA sequencing techniques, we can gain additional insights during development, such as the impacts of local environments, cellular interactions, and intracellular heterogeneity.
