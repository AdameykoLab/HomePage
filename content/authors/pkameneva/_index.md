My projects are focused on the development of chromaffin cells and sympathetic neurons from SCPs in adrenal medulla and paraganglia. 
I study the fate transitions from SCPs to sympathetic VS chromaffin cells in mouse and human as well as potential role of these fate transitions in neuroblastoma. I apply single cell RNA sequencing, lineage tracing and organotypic culture methods in my research.
