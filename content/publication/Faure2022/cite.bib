    abstract = "{scFates provides an extensive toolset for the analysis of dynamic trajectories comprising tree learning, feature association testing, branch differential expression and with a focus on cell biasing and fate splits at the level of bifurcations. It is meant to be fully integrated into the scanpy ecosystem for seamless analysis of trajectories from single-cell data of various modalities (e.g. RNA and ATAC).scFates is released as open-source software under the BSD 3-Clause ‘New’ License and is available from the Python Package Index at https://pypi.org/project/scFates/. The source code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/LouisFaure/scFates/. Code reproduction and tutorials on published datasets are available on GitHub at https://github.com/LouisFaure/scFates\_notebooks.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",
