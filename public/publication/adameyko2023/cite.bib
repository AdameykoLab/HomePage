  abstract  = "The central nervous system (CNS) of chordates, including humans,
               develops as a hollow tube with ciliated walls containing
               cerebrospinal fluid. However, most of the animals inhabiting our
               planet do not use this design and rather build their centralized
               brains from non-epithelialized condensations of neurons called
               ganglia, with no traces of epithelialized tubes or
               liquid-containing cavities. The evolutionary origin of tube-type
               CNSs stays enigmatic, especially as non-epithelialized
               ganglionic-type nervous systems dominate the animal kingdom.
               Here, I discuss recent findings relevant to understanding the
               potential homologies and scenarios of the origin, histology and
               anatomy of the chordate neural tube. The nerve cords of other
               deuterostomes might relate to the chordate neural tube at
               histological, developmental and cellular levels, including the
               presence of radial glia, layered stratification, retained
               epithelial features, morphogenesis via folding and formation of
               a lumen filled with liquid. Recent findings inspire a new view
               of hypothetical evolutionary scenarios explaining the tubular
               epithelialized structure of the CNS. One such idea suggests that
               early neural tubes were key for improved directional olfaction,
               which was facilitated by the liquid-containing internal cavity.
               The later separation of the olfactory portion of the tube led to
               the formation of the independent olfactory and posterior tubular
               CNS systems in vertebrates. According to an alternative
               hypothesis, the thick basiepithelial nerve cords could provide
               deuterostome ancestors with additional biomechanical support,
               which later improved by turning the basiepithelial cord into a
               tube filled with liquid ? a hydraulic skeleton.",
