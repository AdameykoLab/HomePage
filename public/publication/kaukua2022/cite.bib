  abstract = "There are major differences in duration and scale at which limb
              development and regeneration proceed, raising the question to
              what extent regeneration is a recapitulation of development. We
              address this by analyzing skeletal elements using a combination
              of micro-CT imaging, molecular profiling and clonal cell tracing.
              We find that, in contrast to development, regenerative skeletal
              growth is accomplished based entirely on cartilage expansion
              prior to ossification, not limiting the transversal cartilage
              expansion and resulting in bulkier skeletal parts. The oriented
              extension of salamander cartilage and bone appear similar to the
              development of basicranial synchondroses in mammals, as we found
              no evidence for cartilage stem cell niches or growth plate-like
              structures during neither development nor regeneration. Both
              regenerative and developmental ossification in salamanders start
              from the cortical bone and proceeds inwards, showing the
              diversity of schemes for the synchrony of cortical and
              endochondral ossification among vertebrates.",
